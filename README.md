## Build and test this project

To build and test this project you can execute ``sbt test``. You can also use ``sbt`` interactive mode (you just have to execute ``sbt`` in your terminal) and then use the triggered execution to execute your tests using the following commands inside the interactive mode:

```
~ test // Runs every test in your project
~ test-only *AnySpec // Runs specs matching with the filter passed as param.
``` 

## Configuration

This project needs some private Twitter OAuth configuration you can set creating a new file named ``application.conf`` into the ``/src/main/resources/`` folder. Here you have an example:

```
twitter4j {
  oauth {
    consumerKey = YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY
    consumerSecret = YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
    accessToken = YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    accessTokenSecret = YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
  }
}

```

You can get these credentials by creating a Twitter application [here](https://apps.twitter.com/).

## Running on a cluster

Spark applications are developed to run on a cluster. Before to run your app you need to generate a ``.jar`` file you can submit to Spark to be executed. You can generate the ``roma.jar`` file executing ``sbt assembly``. This will generate a binary file you can submit using ``spark-submit`` command. Ensure your local Spark version is ``Spark 2.1.1``. 

You can submit this application to your local spark installation executing these commands:

``
sbt assembly
./submitToLocalSpark.sh
``

You can submit this application to a dockerized Spark cluster using these commands:

```
sbt assembly
cd docker
docker-compse up -d
cd ..
./submitToDockerizedSpark.sh
```
